# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the final project in the Javascript of the Odin Project. I will recreate Instagram app using React, and Firestore. Later, I might replace Firestore with Node.js when I complete that section of the Odin Project.
